---

### **Slide 1: Title & The Challenge**

- **Title:** Stop Guessing, Start Selling
- **Subtitle:** The Rule-Based Lead Scoring Accelerator for Dynamics 365.
- **Key Problem:**
  - Are your reps spending time on leads that will never buy?
  - Do you have a consistent definition of a "Hot" lead?
  - Are high-value referrals getting lost in the noise?

### **Slide 2: Our Solution**

- **Concept:** We embed a smart **Scoring Engine** directly into your CRM.
- **How it Works:**
  1.  **Lead Created:** A prospect fills out a web form or a rep enters a lead.
  2.  **Instant Analysis:** Power Automate instantly checks the lead against _your_ criteria (Budget, Industry, Source).
  3.  **Scoring:** A score (0-100) is calculated and written back to the record.
  4.  **Prioritization:** High-score leads are flagged immediately.

### **Slide 3: Live Demo**

- **Title:** See It in Action
- **(Visual: embed here `ai-lead-scoring-demo.gif`)**
- **Script:** "Watch as we create a lead with a high budget and referral source. Within seconds, the system recognizes the value, assigns a score of 100, and flags it for immediate follow-up."

### **Slide 4: Why Rule-Based?**

- **Transparent:** You know _exactly_ why a lead got a score (unlike "Black Box" AI).
- **Cost-Effective:** No expensive AI licenses required.
- **Fast:** Implemented in days, not months.

### **Slide 5: Next Steps**

- **Proposal:** We recommend a 2-week PoC to define _your_ specific scoring rules and deploy this engine to your development environment.
